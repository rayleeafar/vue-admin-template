# vue-admin-template

## Introduction
> Template project covers common functions such as login authentication, local storage, routing control and data interaction. If you are planning to build a background management system using Vue-related technology stack, this template may help you. If you don't want to build it from scratch, you can clone the template completely without any configuration, and then you can start writing your own business code.

The project includes both the server (using koa2) and the client. After you cloned the code, you just need to run both the server and the client at the same time. 

## Step 1 Clone 

``` bash

# clone code to local
git clone https://github.com/Rennix09/vue-admin-template.git

```

## Step2 Run Client

``` bash

cd ./vue-admin-template

# install client-side packages
npm install

# run client
npm run dev

```

## Step3 Run Server

run a new terminal and [cd] to the code directory.

``` bash

cd ./server

# install server-side package
npm install

# run server
node app.js

``` 

## Step4 Completed!
